# BayesianSensitivity: Learn Sensitivity Analysis in Bayesian Statistics

#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/BayesianSensitivity](https://shinyappstore.com/a/BayesianSensitivity)__

BayesianSensitivity is a valuable educational application designed to elucidate the sensitivity analysis of priors in Bayesian analysis, providing users with a comprehensive understanding of this statistical approach. Bayesian analysis, a method rooted in Bayesian probability theory, involves updating probabilities based on prior knowledge and observed evidence. Sensitivity analysis, in the context of statistical data analysis, refers to the exploration of how variations in input parameters, such as prior distributions, can impact the results of Bayesian models. This application serves as an instructive tool, guiding users through the essential steps of conducting a sensitivity analysis in Bayesian frameworks. By interacting with BayesianSensitivity, users gain practical insights into the nuances of adjusting prior distributions and assessing their influence on Bayesian analysis outcomes, contributing to a deeper comprehension of this powerful statistical methodology.
