Let us say that we want to examine two competing sets of priors, for $\varepsilon^{2}$: $~IG(1, 0.5)$ and $~IG(0.1, 0.1)$. These priors may represent different degrees of informativeness: 

1. The first alternative prior has a higher peak at lower values, which suggests the prior is more informative than the original prior;
2. The second alternative prior is much flatter than the first prior and the original prior, which suggests the prior is more diffuse than the first prior and the original. 

In addition, both alternative priors have previously been used in other studies, and they would be reasonable priors for the residual variance.

Within the app, you can adjust these alternative priors by adjusting the means and variances for each prior. Once you have made adjustments to the priors, you can press the **Run Sensitivity Analysis!** button to get results. Using the tabs in the right-hand panel, you can examine changes in the prior densities, convergence, posterior densities,  and posterior estimates. You can also specify different alternative priors and run another sensitivity analysis.
