Let us say that we want to examine two competing sets of priors, for $\beta_{intercept}$: $~N(0, 100)$ and $~N(20, 10)$. These priors may represent different degrees of informativeness: 

1. The first alternative prior has a variance of 100, which suggests the prior is very diffuse when compared to the second alternative prior and the original prior; 
2. The second alternative prior is more informative than the first prior with a variance of 10, but suggests an alternative theory that levels of cynicism should be lower than recommended in the original prior that had a mean of 41. 

In addition, both alternative priors suggest lower cynicism values considering they have means of 0 and 20, whereas the original prior has a mean of 41.

Within the app, you can adjust these alternative priors by adjusting the means and variances for each prior. Once you have made adjustments to the priors, you can press the **Run Sensitivity Analysis!** button to get results. Using the tabs in the right-hand panel, you can examine changes in the prior densities, convergence, posterior densities,  and posterior estimates. You can also specify different alternative priors and run another sensitivity analysis.
