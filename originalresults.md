The table to the left summarizes the results of the analysis. The posterior densities and histograms can also be seen in the plots below. The density plots and histograms show that all posterior estimates roughly follow a normal distribution, which is what we would expect for a converged model.


While examining the results for the regression coefficients, we can see that the 90% highest posterior density (HPD) interval includes the value zero for the 'Sex' predictor. Based on our prior information and the data, these results suggest there is no effect of 'Sex' on levels of Cynicism. The 90% HPD interval does not include zero for the 'Lack of Trust' predictor, which suggests the 'Lack of Trust' predictor has some effect on levels of Cynicism.

The 'Lack of Trust' regression coefficient posterior might have been driven by the informative prior specified by the researcher. One way to see to what extent the results depend on this informative prior is by performing a sensitivity analysis.
