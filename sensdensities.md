Once you have run a sensitivity analysis, this tab displays the posterior density plots each parameter. Each plot contains the posterior density of the analysis with the original priors and the posterior densities of the alternative prior distributions. It is likely that you will observe the biggest change in the posterior distribution of the parameter for which you are specifying alternative priors. However, make sure to also look at the posterior densities of the other parameters to see how they are affected.
