Once you have run a sensitivity analysis, this tab displays some summary statistics of the posterior distributions. Each table displays the results for one alternative prior specification. One way to examine the impact of different priors is to compute the percentage change in the average posterior estimate between models with different prior distributions. This bias estimate is displayed in the last column of the table. A high percentage of bias implies that the posterior estimate is sensitive to the prior distribution used.
