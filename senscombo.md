As mentioned on the previous pages, an important step for a sensitivity analysis is to select an appropriate set of alternative priors. In some cases, it might make sense for a researcher to look at combinations of alternative priors instead of only changing one prior while keeping the other priors the same:

1. This might occur when an area of research has been well developed that a researcher could identify a set of different priors that match an alternative theory for the entire predicting model.
2. Conversely, it is also possible the researcher wants to look at the overall informativeness of a given set of priors across multiple parameters to better understand how the priors impact the estimates.

The lefthand panel on this page allows the user to select a combination of priors for $\beta_{intercept}$, $\beta_{sex}$, $\beta_{lack of trust}$, and $\varepsilon^{2}$. The values for these priors are copied from the previous pages in the App. Changing the priors on those pages automatically updates the available options on this page.

Once you have selected a set of priors, you can press the **Run Sensitivity Analysis!** button to get results. Using the tabs in the right-hand panel, you can examine changes in the prior densities, convergence, posterior densities,  and posterior estimates. You can also specify different alternative priors and run another sensitivity analysis.
