## Step-by-step sensitivity analysis
Here are the main steps for performing a sensitivity analysis:

1. The researcher predetermines a set of priors to use for model estimation.
2. The model is estimated, and convergence is obtained for all model parameters. 
3. The researcher comes up with a set of “competing” priors to examine. The point here is not to alter the original priors. Rather, it is to examine how robust the original results are when the priors are altered, and the model is re-estimated.  
4. Results are obtained for the “competing” priors and then compared with the original results through a series of visual and statistical comparisons. 
5. The results are written up to reflect the original model results (obtained in Item 1, from the original priors), and the sensitivity analysis results are also presented in order to comment on how robust (or not) the results are to different prior settings.
