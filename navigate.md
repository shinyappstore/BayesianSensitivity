## Navigating the App
To get the most out of this App, we recommend going through each page in order. Here is a short overview of what is included in each page of the App:

1. Original Study: A hypothetical research scenario is introduced, and "the researcher" goes through the first two steps of the sensitivity analysis.
2. Sensitivity Analysis: The next four pages give you the opportunity to perform a sensitivity analysis for each of the four parameters in the model (intercept, regression effect of 'sex', regression effect of 'lack of trust', and the residual variance).
3. On the final page of the app (Sensitivity Analysis: All parameters) you can perform a sensitivity analysis for the entire model, exploring the impact of alternative priors for all parameters combined.
