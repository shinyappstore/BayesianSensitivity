Once you have run a sensitivity analysis, this tab displays the trace plots for each model parameter so that convergence can be assessed. Just as with the original analysis, it is important to check whether there were any convergence issues. If an alternative prior results in issues with convergence, then that provides you with information about the appropriateness of that prior. Changing the prior of one parameter could also lead to convergence problems in another parameter.
