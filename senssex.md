Let us say that we want to examine two competing sets of priors, for $\beta_{sex}$: $~N(5, 5)$ and $~N(-10, 5)$. These priors may map onto (hypothetical) alternative theories in the literature, such as: 

1. A theory in which men exhibit higher levels of cynicism than women;
2. A theory in which women exhibit higher levels of cynicism than men. 

Within the app, you can adjust these alternative priors by adjusting the means and variances for each prior. Once you have made adjustments to the priors, you can press the **Run Sensitivity Analysis!** button to get results. Using the tabs in the right-hand panel, you can examine changes in the prior densities, convergence, posterior densities,  and posterior estimates. You can also specify different alternative priors and run another sensitivity analysis.
