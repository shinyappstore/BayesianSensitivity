Let us say that we want to examine two competing sets of priors, for $\beta_{lack of trust}$: $~N(0, 100)$ and $~N(0, 5)$. These priors may represent different degrees of informativeness: 

1. The first alternative prior has a variance of 100, which suggests the prior is very diffuse when compared to the second alternative prior and the original prior; 
2. The second alternative prior is more informative than the first prior with a variance of 5, but less informative than the original prior that had a variance of 1. 

In addition, both alternative priors suggest a less pronounced relationship between lack of trust and cynicism considering they have means of 0, whereas the original prior has a mean of 6.

Within the app, you can adjust these alternative priors by adjusting the means and variances for each prior. Once you have made adjustments to the priors, you can press the **Run Sensitivity Analysis!** button to get results. Using the tabs in the right-hand panel, you can examine changes in the prior densities, convergence, posterior densities,  and posterior estimates. You can also specify different alternative priors and run another sensitivity analysis.
